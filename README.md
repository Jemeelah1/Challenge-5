# Challenge 5 - Whack-a-Food
Challenge Overview:

Put your User Interface skills to the test with this whack-a-mole-like challenge in which you have to get all the food that pops up on a grid while avoiding the skulls.  You will have to debug buttons, mouse clicks, score tracking, restart sequences, and difficulty setting to get to the bottom of this one. 

Challenge Outcome:

All of the buttons look nice with their text properly aligned
When you select a difficulty, the spawn rate changes accordingly
When you click a food, it is destroyed and the score is updated in the top-left
When you lose the game, a restart button appears that lets you play again
